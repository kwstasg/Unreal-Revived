# Testing

Automated coverage is not yet available for the renderer. Every behavior change
must receive a focused build plus the relevant disposable-runtime checks below.
Record significant results in [`progress.md`](progress.md).

## Repository guard

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/check-repository.ps1
```

This must pass before committing or packaging. It ensures ignored game, SDK,
reference, binary, log, save, and build artifacts have not entered the project.

## Build validation

```powershell
cmake -S . -B local/build -A x64
cmake --build local/build --config Release
cmake --build local/build --target deploy-d3d12drv --config Release
```

The deploy target is available only when the configured game root contains
`System64/Unreal.exe`.

## Runtime launch

From the disposable runtime's `System64` directory, use:

```powershell
.\Unreal.exe Unreal.unr ini=D3D12Test.ini userini=D3D12TestUser.ini
```

Confirm the process loads `D3D12Drv.dll` and does not load `XOpenGLDrv.dll` as a
fallback. Inspect `Unreal.log` after shutdown for initialization failures,
Direct3D errors, assertions, or unexpected relaunches.

## Rendering checklist

- Verify BSP surfaces and actors render in representative indoor and outdoor
  maps.
- Verify HD lightmaps have expected color and intensity, with no black or
  magenta corruption.
- Verify masked textures, translucent surfaces, fog maps, coronas, detail
  textures, and volumetric lighting.
- Verify realtime and scripted textures update rather than retaining stale
  frames.
- Verify precaching enabled and disabled.
- Verify screenshots with gamma correction enabled and disabled.
- Exercise `Off`, `MSAA_2x`, and `MSAA_4x` antialiasing.
- Exercise VSync enabled and disabled and confirm intended high-refresh or
  uncapped presentation behavior with an external frame-rate measurement.

## Resolution and window checklist

- Start at the desktop's native resolution.
- Select at least one lower 16:9 resolution in borderless fullscreen.
- Confirm the image remains centered and correctly letterboxed.
- Confirm menu hover and click targets align at native and lower resolutions.
- Confirm the lower logical resolution is not reset to desktop dimensions.
- Switch between windowed, fullscreen, and borderless modes.
- Alt-tab repeatedly and verify rendering and input recover.
- Resize a window and verify swap-chain recreation does not hang or crash.

## Startup and campaign checklist

- Launch through `Unreal.unr` without forcing a campaign map.
- Open Game, then New Game.
- Confirm both `Unreal` and `Return to Na Pali` are listed.
- Start Unreal and confirm travel begins at `Vortex2`.
- Start Return to Na Pali and confirm travel begins at `Intro1`.
- Confirm campaign screenshots and skill selection render correctly.

If the campaign combo is empty, verify that `System/UnrealShare.int` and
`System/UPak.int` match the files in `SystemLocalized/int/`. The deployment
target maintains those copies for the disposable runtime.

## Reporting results

A useful test record includes:

- OldUnreal host and architecture;
- build configuration and commit or working-tree state;
- GPU, driver, desktop resolution, and refresh rate;
- renderer settings changed from defaults;
- checks performed and their outcomes;
- relevant log or screenshot paths under ignored `local/` storage.
